Open the Binary Matrix Solution Generator.zip in order to use the algorithm.
The source code of the project can be found in the "src" folder.
Resources are located in the "res" folder".
Do not alter any files in the "Binary Matrix Solution Generator_lib folder in the zip file or else the program may not function properly.

Enjoy :)
