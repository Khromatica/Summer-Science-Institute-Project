Open the Binary Matrix Solution Generator.zip in order to use the algorithm.
The source code of the project can be found in the "src" folder.
Resources are located in the "Combination Resources" folder".
Place this folder on the Desktop of the current user.
Do not alter any files in the resources in the package or else the program may not function properly.

Enjoy :)
